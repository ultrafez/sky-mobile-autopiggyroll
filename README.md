# Sky Mobile AutoPiggyRoll

Automatically roll data back from your Sky Piggybank to one or more SIM cards when their data allowance runs low.

Utilises the Playwright automation test framework to screenscrape the Sky website using Chromium to get SIM card data balances, and roll data back to each SIM if needed.

## Setup

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set configuration values.

Using Node 20 (may work on other versions, untested) - `npm install`

## Running

`npx playwright test`

## Code structure

Follows a standard Playwright project as generated by the Playwright npm init script.

Checking balances and rolling where required is all performed as a single "test case".

## Aspirations

* Improve these docs
* Package this up using Docker
* Run periodically on cloud infra (for my personal use)
* Make easy for others to run on their own/cloud infra (for their personal use)
